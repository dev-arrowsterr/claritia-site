# tryclaritia.com

Static site for Claritia. Plain HTML and CSS: no WordPress, no JavaScript, no build step.
It is set up the same way as perceptric.com.

The home page is a copy of the Next.js home page in the app repo (`src/app/page.tsx`).
It looks the same, uses the same words, and sends every button to the same place.

## How it's laid out

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The home page. |
| `404.html` | The "page not found" page. Its own styles sit in a `<style>` block at the top. |
| `assets/base.css` | Brand colors, reset, logo, tags, buttons, header and footer. |
| `assets/home.css` | Styles for the home page. |
| `assets/brand/` | Favicon, icon, Apple touch icon and the share image (`og-image.png`). |
| `llms.txt` | A short guide to Claritia for AI tools. |
| `pricing.md` | The plans as a Markdown table. |
| `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` | For search engines. |
| `.htaccess` | https and www redirects, the 404 page, text file types, old app links, cache times. |

## Editing

- **Home page words:** `index.html`. Each section starts with a comment, like `<!-- Pricing -->`.
- **Home page look:** `assets/home.css`. Colors and shared pieces are in `assets/base.css`.
  The page font size is 14px, so `1rem` is 14px. Breakpoints are 640px, 768px and 1024px.
- **Header and footer:** they sit in both `index.html` and `404.html`. Change both.
  With two pages there is no partials folder or layout script.
- **Prices and plan limits:** the cards in the `<!-- Pricing -->` section of `index.html`, the table in
  `pricing.md`, and `src/lib/plans.ts` in the app. Change all three together.
- **/llms.txt:** edit `llms.txt`. Keep it in step with `src/app/llms.txt/route.ts` in the app.
- **Footer year:** typed into the footer of both pages. Change it in January.
- **New page:** make a folder with an `index.html` (copy `404.html` to start, since it has the header
  and footer). Give it a title, description and canonical tag, drop the `noindex` line, and add it to
  `sitemap.xml`.

Follow `docs/brand.md` in the app repo: square boxes, 6px corners on buttons and fields, square tags,
no shadows on cards, no gradients, no emoji.

Preview locally: `python3 -m http.server 8000`, then open http://localhost:8000.
The local server ignores `.htaccess`, so redirects and the 404 page only work on Hostinger.

Push to `main` and Hostinger deploys it.

## Paths with no page of their own

| Path | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/llms.txt` | A real file, served as `text/plain; charset=utf-8`. |
| `/pricing.md` | A real file, served as `text/markdown; charset=utf-8`. |
| `/tests`, `/runs`, `/settings` and the other app paths | A 308 redirect to the same path on app.tryclaritia.com. The query string comes along. |
| Anything else | The 404 page. |

The app paths are listed in `.htaccess`. Add a path there when the app gets a new top-level page.
`.htaccess` also hides the `.git` folder, dot files and this README, since Hostinger deploys the whole repo.

## Hostinger setup

1. **Add the site.** In hPanel, go to Websites → Add website and pick tryclaritia.com.
   Choose an empty website, with no WordPress and no builder.
   If WordPress is already installed on tryclaritia.com from the old theme, remove it first and empty `public_html`.
2. **Connect this repo.** In hPanel, open the site, then Advanced → Git.
   - Repository: this repo's GitHub address. For a private repo, add the deploy key hPanel shows to the repo
     (GitHub → Settings → Deploy keys).
   - Branch: `main`.
   - Install path: leave it empty, so the site lands in the domain's `public_html`. The folder must be empty.
   - Create, then press Deploy. Turn on auto deployment and add the webhook URL hPanel gives you to the
     GitHub repo (Settings → Webhooks), so each push to `main` deploys.
3. **Turn on SSL.** In hPanel, check that the free SSL certificate covers `tryclaritia.com` and `www.tryclaritia.com`.
   The https redirect in `.htaccess` needs it.
4. **Check.** Open `/`, `/llms.txt`, `/pricing.md`, `/nope` (it should show the 404 page) and `/tests?x=1`
   (it should land on `app.tryclaritia.com/tests?x=1`). Also try `http://` and `www.`: both should end on
   `https://tryclaritia.com/`. If you see an old page, purge the cache in hPanel (Performance → Cache Manager).

If the site or `/tests` gives a server error, the server may not accept `R=308`.
Change it to `R=301` in `.htaccess`.

## DNS

The DNS for tryclaritia.com is managed in Hostinger (hPanel → Domains → tryclaritia.com → DNS).

- `tryclaritia.com` and `www.tryclaritia.com` point to Hostinger. Until this site is live they still point
  to Render (the old Next.js site). To switch, replace those two Render records with the ones hPanel gives
  for the website (an A record for `@` and a CNAME for `www`).
- `app.tryclaritia.com` is a CNAME to `claritia-web.fly.dev` (the app on Fly.io). Leave it as it is.
- Leave the Resend records for the test inboxes (`inbox.tryclaritia.com`) as they are.

Once `tryclaritia.com` points here, visits to it never reach the Next.js app, so the app needs no change.
The app keeps its own copy of /llms.txt and /pricing.md on app.tryclaritia.com.

## Running cost

| Item | Beta (50 teams) | Growth (500 teams) |
|---|---|---|
| Hostinger hosting | $0 extra, on the existing Hostinger plan | $0 extra |
| Google Fonts, no tracking, no paid add-ons | $0 | $0 |
| Total added to the monthly bill | $0 | $0 |

The site makes no AI calls.
